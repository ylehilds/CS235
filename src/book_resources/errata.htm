  DATE   PAGE  WHO  PROBLEM
--------  ---  ---  ----------------------------------------------------------
03/15/06   39   KA  Change DIFFERENT_NUMBERS to DIFF_NUMBERS
11/16/07   62   CA  In Exercise 2.14, change "dividend" to "divisor"
06/01/07  152   CA  In definition of super object, "overloading" should be "overriding".
06/01/07  186   SA  In the bound for the number of iterations and comparisons
                       for the revised binary search, replace the floor
                       function with the ceiling function.
03/15/06  209   VH  Line 2 and 3: clarify that ordered/unordered
                    refers to sroted order, not positional (indexed) order
03/15/06  210   EG  Line -8, Change Section 4.8 to Section 4.1.11.
05/07/08  217   RS  In Figure 6.14, line 72, remove ; at the end of the line
09/27/07  353   RH  The third paragraph refers to two loops in Figure 9.6.
                    But only the second loop is in the code, so remove the
                    sentence that refers to the first loop.
03/15/06  410   PL  Line 24 in Figure 11.17 should be
                       long theResult = postfixStack.pop( );
06/01/07  461   EB  The import directive on line 1, Figure 13.6 should be
                       for class weiss.util.Random to support Poisson distributions.
09/26/06  484   OA  Delete line 45, which only works if main is in class Graph.
05/07/08  484  SSC  Change line 9 to "source destination cost"
03/15/06  537   EG  Figure 15.18, line 11 is missing a ) before the ;
06/01/07  541       In Figure 16.2, line 26, change Object to AnyType
03/15/06  568   EG  Line -12, change LinkedList constructor to
                    LinkedListIterator constructor
06/21/06  585  EEO  getNode throws an exception if idx > size(), rather than
                    idx > size() - 1, but since it is called directly by
                    get, set, and remove( int idx ), all those routines fail
                    to throw an exception when the index is size(). The
                    simplest fix is as follows: change getNode to accept
                    two additional parameters (lower and upper), to be
                    used in the test at line 11. Provide a second getNode
                    with only one parameter, that passes 0 and size() -1.
                    This will fix get, set, and remove. But it breaks add,
                    and the LinkedListIterator constructor because size() is
                    a valid index for those. In those routines
                    invoke the three-parameter getNode, with 0, and size()
                    as the lower and upper bounds. This fix is in the
                    revised online code.

03/15/06  589   EG  Figure 17.30b, lines 59 and 60 are not needed.
06/01/07  597       Figure 18.2, change T_4 to T_k
06/21/06  701   MAW Line 5, change "child" to "item"
04/04/06  732   EA  In Figre 7.32, there is an inconsistency that increments
                    occupied, even if the newly inserted item replaces an
                    item marked as deleted. To fix, move line 14 to before line
                    12 and test if array[ currentPos ] is null.
03/15/06  870   EG  show() is deprecated. setVisible(true) is preferred.
03/15/06  880   EG  show() is deprecated. setVisible(true) is preferred.
